# Product landing page
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tywmick/pen/bJQBRz](https://codepen.io/tywmick/pen/bJQBRz).

 In fulfillment of [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)'s Responsive Web Design Project [Build a Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/). Modeled some after [their example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/RKRbwL) but inspired more by [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com)'s  [Parallax Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_parallax&stacked=h). And my own [Lens Captions homepage](https://lenscaptions.com), which I'd built with [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com)'s website builder.

Built with [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp).
